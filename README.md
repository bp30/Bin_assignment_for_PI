README:
bin_script.R contains scripts to help PI (Dr. Christopher Erb) with data manipulation. It sorts and spilt trials to n number of bins according to their responses in the CueFixation_mean column. This is done separately for each participant and for each congruency trial type. For example, if participant 1 completed 30 trials in the congruent condition and 28 trials in the incongruent condition, assuming there are 5 bins, then there will be 6 trials in the congruent condition assigned to bins 1-5, 6 trials in the incongruent condition assigned bins 1-3 and 5 trials assigned to bins 4-5.
